Silence fills the air;
Echoes fade away
Sadness and despair
On that cruel and fateful day

My body lies motionless
Upon the kitchen floor
The Earth has died, the world's at rest:
2084

Many centuries ago
In a dark, enchanted land
Our fate had been foretold
By a poor, misguided man
We carried on down the road we chose-
The path of Nevermore
The journey ends, the book is closed
2084

And now I have to leave, my work on Earth is done
I'm heading for the planet known as Mars
To the last of its race, the final newborn son
Before I start my voyage to the stars

And now I have to leave, my work on Earth is done
I'm heading for the planet known as Mars
To the last of its race, the final newborn son
Before I start my voyage to the stars

My body lies motionless
Upon the kitchen floor
The Earth has died, the world's at rest
2084...
